# Attack

To run, run prjATTACK.exe. A server can be started using prjATTACKSERVER.exe.

Attack is a game I created in 2011 in Grade 10 for my final project in ICS3U.
It is written in VB6, which I was forced to use. While the language has a
couple nice features, you need to go out of your way to do anything useful. I
would not recommend using VB6 for a game. Or anything, really.

Looking at this code now, I find it pretty messy, with lots of repeated code.
I should have used more subroutines, and could refactor much of the code. In my
opinion, this code doesn't illustrate what my current programming ability is,
see some of my other repositories for that.

# Story

Your castle is under siege! Luckily, you are the main producer of flail heads
for the kingdom. Unfortunately, you have run out of flail handles. Fortunately,
you have a cannon!

Gather your friends and defend your castle against increasingly large hordes of
monsters!
